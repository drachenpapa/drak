abstract: >
  Zatacka is a remake of the classic multiplayer game (also known as Achtung, die Kurve! or Curve Fever), built in Java. Originally created during a school internship, the game has now been modernized with a focus on code quality and modern principles. Players control growing curves and try to outlast their opponents by avoiding collisions with all curves.
