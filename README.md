> :information_source: This repository contains a Java implementation of the game Zatacka, originally created during a school internship in 2007. The project has been preserved for historical purposes and the original source code can be found in the [original-src](#original-src) directory. The goal is to both **archive** the old source code and **modernize** the project using more up-to-date tools and practices. The original code reflects the programming knowledge and practices from that time, which may differ significantly from modern Java standards. It serves as a snapshot of what was done back then and is not representative of my actual coding skills or current best practices.


A remake of the classic multiplayer game **Zatacka** (also known as _Achtung, die Kurve!_), built using Java Swing. In this game, players control a growing line (curve), trying to outlast opponents by avoiding collisions with lines, walls, and themselves.


## Features
- Multiplayer game, where each player controls a curve using their keyboard.
- Randomized starting positions and directions for each round.
- Adjustable game settings via a simple user interface.
- Players accumulate points as long as they stay alive in the game.
- Built with Java Swing for the graphical interface.


## How to Play
- Each player uses two keys to turn left or right.
- The goal is to avoid crashing into walls, your own curve, or other players' curves.
- The last surviving player wins the round and earns points.
- Customize the game settings before starting a match.
