## Contributing

As of June 2025, I don't plan to revisit the project and add new features or change the game mechanics.
I might occasionally update dependencies, GitHub Actions, or the documentation, but otherwise no changes are planned.

If you want to contribute, be my guest! Open a pull request or an issue and start contributing.
I will review contributions and merge them if they align with the project's goals and quality standards.
Please note that I might not be able to respond to every contribution or issue due to time constraints,  
and I might not agree with every proposed change, especially if it alters the core mechanics or feel of the game.
Otherwise, feel free to fork the repository and create your own version if you have different ideas or visions for the game.
